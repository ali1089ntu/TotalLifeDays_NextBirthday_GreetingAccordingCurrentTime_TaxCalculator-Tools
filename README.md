# TotalLifeDays_NextBirthday_GreetingAccordingCurrentTime_TaxCalculator-Tools
As clear from the repository name, basically there are four types of tools developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript. If a user sets its birth details (mm-dd-yyyy) in the above input field and clicks on the Total Days Since Birth Button then, it automatically displays the total number of days since birth till current date and time and also displays the current time of clicking the button. If a user clicks on the Greeting Button, then it displays a prompt in which you have to enter your name and it is displays a message of greeting Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night depending on current time. If a user sets the next birthday date and year in the input field and clicks on the Next Birthday Button, then it displays the remaining days left in his/her Birthday. Last, If a user clicks on the Calculate Tax button, then it displays a prompt in which you have to enter an amount on which you want to calculate tax, if the amount is less than 1000 then the tax deduction will be 12%, if greater than 1000 or less than 5000 then the tax deduction will be 18% and if greater than 5000 then the tax deduction will be 21% and after that it displays a message that you have to pay whatever amount of tax depending upon the amount you have entered.
